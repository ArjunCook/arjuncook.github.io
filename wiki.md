In the United States, we have a dual system that determines who can use water, and where. What determines where you will get your water is geography, as the east and western half of the USA use diffent sets of laws. 

**Riparian Rights**: Riparian rights are based on the principle of water access and use being tied to land ownership along a watercourse. Under riparian rights, *individuals who own land adjacent to a water source (such as a river or stream) have the right to reasonable use of that water*. The key aspect of riparian rights is the concept of "reasonable use," which typically implies that the water should not be wasted or unreasonably impaired. In riparian systems, water is generally shared among the landowners with adjacent property, and their rights are considered equal. Disputes over water usage are often resolved through negotiation or legal processes that aim to balance the interests of riparian rights holders.

**Prior Appropriation**: Prior appropriation is a legal framework that focuses on allocating water rights based on a system of priority and beneficial use. *In prior appropriation systems, the first person or entity to claim water rights and put the water to "beneficial use" typically has priority over subsequent users*. Beneficial use refers to using water for specific purposes such as irrigation, industrial processes, or domestic use. This system prioritizes the efficient allocation of water resources, and it allows individuals or entities who have acquired water rights through the legal process to continue using the water even if others may have riparian rights. Prior appropriation systems often involve the administration of permits and licenses to control water rights and manage allocation.

## History of Prior Appropriation Laws
Westward Expansion and Water Scarcity: The expansion of settlers into the western territories of the United States presented new challenges due to water scarcity in arid regions. As a result, riparian rights were sometimes found to be impractical in allocating water resources. The need for a different legal framework led to the development of prior appropriation systems in some western states, where water rights were based on priority of use rather than land ownership.

### Effects
Interstate and Federal Water Management: Water management in the Western states often extends beyond state boundaries due to shared river basins and interstate water disputes. In such cases, interstate compacts and agreements have been formed to coordinate water allocation among multiple states. Additionally, the federal government has played a role in water management through agencies like the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers, particularly in the development of large-scale water projects and infrastructure.

## History of Riparian Right Laws
Colonial Era and Early American Law: During the colonial era, the English legal principles regarding riparian rights were incorporated into the legal systems of the American colonies. However, the specific application of riparian rights varied among the colonies based on local conditions and needs. For example, New England colonies, with their abundant rainfall, generally followed a more restrictive interpretation of riparian rights compared to Southern colonies, which relied heavily on irrigation.

### Effects
State Laws and Legal Precedents: Following the formation of the United States, the regulation of water resources and the definition of riparian rights became the purview of individual states. Each state developed its own set of laws and regulations based on local circumstances, needs, and legal traditions. These laws were influenced by court decisions and legal precedents that shaped the interpretation and application of riparian rights in different regions.


## Legal Grey Areas
Groundwater Regulation: While surface water allocation is often regulated under prior appropriation or riparian rights, the legal framework for groundwater allocation can be less clear. In some states, groundwater is treated as a separate resource and may have distinct legal regimes. The division between surface water and groundwater rights and the management of shared aquifers can create grey areas and conflicts in water allocation.

Interbasin Transfers: Transferring water from one river basin to another can pose legal challenges. Prior appropriation and riparian rights may not adequately address the issue of interbasin transfers. The legal requirements, permitting processes, and the potential impacts on both the source and receiving basins can create complexities and disputes.

Environmental Considerations: The traditional water allocation systems, whether based on prior appropriation or riparian rights, primarily focus on beneficial human use of water. As environmental concerns and the recognition of ecological values grow, the legal grey area arises regarding how water allocations should consider the needs of ecosystems and environmental protection. Balancing human water demands with ecological requirements can be a challenge within existing frameworks.
